## Foundation model

Klever is designed with a multi-layered architecture that prioritizes empathy, accessibility, and adaptability. At its core, Klever integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities, ensuring responses are not only conversationally engaging but also deeply informed by verified, up-to-date resources. This allows Klever to combine the general intelligence of AI with the specificity and accuracy of a domain expert.

The “Trusted Advisor” ethos is embedded in every interaction. This is why we place such a strong emphasis on building rapport with users. Through the reciprocity framework, Klever encourages an ongoing dialogue with seniors that is not transactional but relational. As users share more about their lives, preferences, and challenges, Klever refines its understanding, offering solutions that are not just helpful but meaningful and highly personalized.

Simplicity underpins Klever’s design philosophy. By categorizing needs into four intuitive domains—essentials, wellness, connection, and personalized learning—the system ensures that users can quickly and effortlessly navigate their options. Whether it’s managing health appointments, discovering new hobbies, or finding local events to connect with others, Klever acts as a reliable guide, reducing the friction of modern technology.

## Proactive Intent 

Klever is also proactive, using its knowledge of user preferences and habits to anticipate needs. For instance, it might gently remind users of upcoming medical appointments, suggest wellness routines based on health data, or recommend learning opportunities that align with their interests. This proactive assistance fosters a sense of being cared for—a hallmark of true trustworthiness.

Additionally, privacy and security are at the forefront of Klever’s commitment to its users. The platform ensures that all interactions and data are securely encrypted, adhering to the highest ethical standards for AI development. Transparency is integral to building trust, which is why users are empowered to control what they share and are clearly informed about how their information is used to enhance their experience.

In essence, Klever is more than just an AI tool; it’s a companion that evolves with its users. By combining state-of-the-art AI technology with humanistic values, Klever redefines what it means to interact with technology. It aims to bridge the gap between what technology can do and what people truly need, creating a digital advisor that feels less like a machine and more like a caring, knowledgeable partner.

Through Klever, we envision a future where technology not only simplifies life but enriches it, offering seniors a sense of empowerment, connection, and peace of mind—because that’s what a Trusted Advisor should do.

## A Trusted Advisor

Klever allows a serendipitously-paced user-led expansion of features or context areas queried. Since all features are organized into 4 buckets, the Guide demonstrates what it looks like from the user’s point-of-view a sample of a substantive inquiry into the new topics, and how such inquiries alter or grow the capability of Steady Hand.

KleverAI focus on mobile accessibility, implementing a Low Vision Accessibility dialog prompt, emphasizes the combined consideration of content, user interface, extensions, applications, and user agents. By tracking user interactions, Klever automatically adjusts preferences and hides unused options. For example, if a user rarely uses travel assistance, the bot deprioritizes or even hides this feature from prominent screens.Preferences could adapt over time, evolving alongside the user’s needs as they grow more comfortable or have different requirements, keeping the interface as straightforward as possible.

## Klever Moments

We Created “Klever Moments” introduces features or reminders at relevant times. For instance, if the Klever bot detects a potential scam call, it could introduce ScamGuard as part of the interaction, explaining its purpose right when it’s most useful. This allows users to discover features through natural interaction, increasing the chance they’ll feel comfortable using them since they’re introduced with context.

Users are offered a simple display of controls available within the user agent interface, including user-installed add-ons to streamline their interaction experience.
